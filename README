This is currently in a very early alpha Stage!!!

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
NEVER USE IT TO ACCESS/WRITE ANYTHING ACTUALLY IMPORTANT!

It is full of bugs and requires alot more test, so I do not consider this
stable, also the API changes about every other day.

-------

That being said, if you really want to see what this is about I suggest
looking at the examples, since this is what I wanted to do and designed
this library arround.

Step #1: Insert a very basic User Model into Cassandra

Start with the usage example:
 - spec/examples/user_create_spec.rb
then look at 
 - spec/examples/user_model.rb
to see the actual User Model implementation.


Step #2: Index Users by Name
 - spec/examples/user_name_index_spec.rb
 - spec/examples/user_name_index_model.rb


Step #3: Index created Users partitioned by Date
  - you know where ...
  

-------

If you actually want to run those examples to see that it IS actually working
you'll need the following:

A running Cassandra instance at '127.0.0.1:9160' with a proper KeySpace:

I'm not gonna cover installing cassandra,

Keyspace should look like:

<Keyspace Name="GreekArchitectByExample">
    <ColumnFamily CompareWith="AsciiType" Name="User" />
    <ColumnFamily CompareWith="UTF8Type" Name="UserNameIndex" />
    <ColumnFamily CompareWith="TimeUUIDType" Name="UserListIndex" />

    <ReplicaPlacementStrategy>org.apache.cassandra.locator.RackUnawareStrategy</ReplicaPlacementStrategy>
    <ReplicationFactor>1</ReplicationFactor>
    <EndPointSnitch>org.apache.cassandra.locator.EndPointSnitch</EndPointSnitch>
</Keyspace>


Ruby Gems and this lib (no gem release yet):

gem install msgpack
gem install json
gem install thrift_client
gem install rspec --pre

git clone git://github.com/thheller/greek_architect.git
cd greek_architect
rspec spec

and hope for something like:

Finished in 0.36562 seconds
8 examples, 0 failures

;)



About the Name:
Greek Architects used a lot of Columns to build some impressive Structures
and so does Cassandra (muhahahah ...)
