h1. failing specs

for some reason some testcases will fail SOMETIMES when reading back the results they wrote

I'm using ONE/ONE for read/write consistency
and I'm under the impression that should equal "read my writes"
but maybe not, need to check

usually just rerunning the test will pass but sometimes it takes
a couple more attempts which is rather annoying

need to investigate
