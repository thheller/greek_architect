just about everything!


Need to investigate:

CLASS AUTOLOADING (RELOADING)

I'm pretty sure any kind of auto loading (rails) will screw this up big time.

Configuration happens at class definition time and is stored in the GreekArchitect Runtime and autoloading probably causes duplicate values and the like. So dont use it within anything that does auto-loading!


SUPER COLUMNS
